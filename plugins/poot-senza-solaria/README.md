**UPDATED 1/18/2026, for ES 1.16.0**

Senza Solaria is a small part of a much larger plugin called Peripherals Or Outstanding Trinkets (POOT).
However, I found Senza Solaria Station to be too fun to be only availble in POOT.
  
  
# Senza Solaria Station (All-Outfit Station)
Senza Solaria is an all-outfits station, with a twist: In order for any of the stations to sell an outfit or ship, you have to **_bring the outfit or ship to the station itself_**.



## Unlocking Outfits and Ships
- For outfits, the outfit **must be IN the cargohold** of one of your ships within the system
- For ships, the ship **must be in your fleet in the system, but NOT the flagship** _(This is done to prevent the station from trying to potentially take your only ship and leave you stranded, softlocked)_



Once you arrive at the station with the item, you will be prompted to donate the item (And don't worry about refusing to donate at the moment, you can always do it anytime in the future).
Once you have given up the item to the station, the next time you land on the station, it will be availible for purchase



### **NOTE: Donations can ONLY BE MADE AT SENZA SOLARIA, IN RUTILICUS**. Outfits that have been donated can still be purchased at any of the Solaria stations, however.

All outfits and ships as of 1.16.0 are supported. If you would like to add support for a plugin, or update Senza Solaria to the newest version of the game, be sure to use the [Senza Solaria Generator script](https://github.com/Eggapegawsus/Eggapegawsus-endless-sky-plugins/tree/main/tools/scripts/senza-solaria-generator)
