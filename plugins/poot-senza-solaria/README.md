**UPDATED 1/18/2026, for ES 1.16.0**

Senza Solaria was originally intended to be a part of a much larger plugin call Peripherals or Outstanding Trinkets (poot), but gradually evolved into something I felt should be a standalone plugin.
  
  
# Senza Solaria Station (All-Outfit Station)
Senza Solaria is a progressively unlocking All-outfits station with a special unlocking requirement:
 - In order for any of the stations to sell an outfit or ship, you have to **_bring the outfit or ship to the station_**

## An All Outfit Station With Special Mechanics
I always enjoyed playing with all outfit plugins like Ursa Polaris or Omnis, although it always felt like there were some issues I had while playing with them:
 - You either had to beat the main campaign in order to unlock anything, or had everything right there from the getgo
 - If there were unlockable outfits, it felt WAY to easy ro get everythinf incredibly quickly
 - Updates and plugin support. Yes, while you could go make a few quick missions or edit outfitters and shipyards to bring it up to date, having to do that manually EVERY time the game or a plugin updates gets pretty tiring pretty fast.

## Senza Solaria's Features
With this being my own personal take on what I'd like from an all outfits plugin, I decided to include some of my own special features:

 - The station is availible from the beginning of the game
 - Items are unlocked on an as-obtained basis (More info below)
 - Outfits and ships are supported (Variables are somewhat, see below)
 - Built in plugin support, with templates for adding plugins
 - A script to automatically update the outfit list compatible with both, plugins and the base game (More info Below)

## Unlocking Outfits and Ships
- For outfits, the outfit **must be IN the cargohold** of one of your ships within the system
- For ships, the ship **must be in your fleet in the system, but NOT the flagship** _(This is done to prevent the station from trying to potentially take your only ship and leave you stranded, softlocked)_



Once you arrive at the station with the item, you will be prompted to donate the item (And don't worry about refusing to donate at the moment, you can always do it anytime in the future).
Once you have given up the item to the station, the next time you land on the station, it will be availible for purchase



### **NOTE: Donations can ONLY BE MADE AT SENZA SOLARIA, IN RUTILICUS**. Outfits that have been donated can still be purchased at any of the Solaria stations, however.


All outfits and ships as of 1.16.0 are supported.
