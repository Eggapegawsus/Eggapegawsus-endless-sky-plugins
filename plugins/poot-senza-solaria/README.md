**UPDATED 1/18/2026, for ES 1.16.0**

Senza Solaria was originally intended to be a part of a much larger plugin call Peripherals or Outstanding Trinkets (poot), but gradually evolved into something much more specific...
  
  
# Senza Solaria Station (All-Outfit Station)
Senza Solaria is a progressively unlocking All-outfits station with a specific unlock requirement
 - In order for any of the stations to sell an outfit or ship, you have to **_bring the outfit or ship to the station itself_**.


I always enjoyed playing with plugins like Ursa Polaris, although it always felt like it had a few problems to me:
 - You had to beat the main campaign in order for it to unlock (Which is not a problem for some iutfits, would be a bit overpowered to get some outfits right at the beginning of the game)
 - It always felt far to easy or quick to get outfits unlock, you just do a handful of quick missions and all of a sudden, EVERY outfit in the game immediately availible at once
 - Updates and plugin support. Yes, while you could go make a few quick missions to bring it up to date, having to do that manually EVERY time the game or a plugin updates gets pretty tiring pretty fast.

With Senza Solaria, I attempted to make my own 



## Unlocking Outfits and Ships
- For outfits, the outfit **must be IN the cargohold** of one of your ships within the system
- For ships, the ship **must be in your fleet in the system, but NOT the flagship** _(This is done to prevent the station from trying to potentially take your only ship and leave you stranded, softlocked)_



Once you arrive at the station with the item, you will be prompted to donate the item (And don't worry about refusing to donate at the moment, you can always do it anytime in the future).
Once you have given up the item to the station, the next time you land on the station, it will be availible for purchase



### **NOTE: Donations can ONLY BE MADE AT SENZA SOLARIA, IN RUTILICUS**. Outfits that have been donated can still be purchased at any of the Solaria stations, however.

All outfits and ships as of 1.16.0 are supported. If you would like to add support for a plugin, or update Senza Solaria to the newest version of the game, be sure to use the [Senza Solaria Generator script](https://github.com/Eggapegawsus/Eggapegawsus-endless-sky-plugins/tree/main/tools/scripts/senza-solaria-generator)
