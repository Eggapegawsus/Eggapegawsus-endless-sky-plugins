	description ` A colossal space station filled to the brim with various intricate and complex assembly structures and research facilities, the Senza Solaris is truly a monument to behold. Despite being covered in a multitide of different facilities, this station has incredibly few people present for a station of its size. There are impressive amounts of androids, machinery, and assembly lines constructing various outfits, weaponry, and space ready vessels.`
	spaceport ` When you arrive at the spaceport, you are almost mesmorized by the sheer scale of the landing pads and rows among rows of factories. the spaceport and factories are incredibly well kept and open, with enough landing pads that even the largest of Navy fleets could land without hassle.  Despite the station being almost completely devoid of life, there are a surprising amount of people walking around the spaceport, mostly observing different machines and freshly made outfits and ships, talking to each other and jotting down notes.`

	description ` A massive worldforge of a space station. Factories, androids, and massive assembly machines dominate the overwhelming majority of the station, with what little remains being dedicated to verious outfitters, shipyards, landing pads, and just enough housing and utility buildings to provide for the few residents of the station.`
	spaceport ` At every turn you take, you feel like you are in the way of someone doing something urgent. Walking through the spaceport gives you the perpetual feeling of almost being trampled by a roaming android, tripped by a speedwalking worker, or flattened by heavy machinery. You feel you should probably head somewhere else and get out of their way, for their well being, and your own.`

Despite claims of being a newly constructed station for Solaria, there are marks along the inner walls of the station, leading one to believe that this station was used previously for something else...`
	spaceport ` The spaceport is unlike any you've seen before. Exposed landing pads facing out into exposed space are placed at various heights extending out of the side of the rocky terrain of the station, with tunnels leading from the landing pads into the interior of the station. There also must be some sort of gravity and atmosphere altering technology aboard the station, seeing how you can breath and walk around a spaceport directly exposed to open space...`

There are also a notable amount of armed turrets and security cameras located throughout the station.`

Walking through the spaceport, you see various dissapointed and angry travellers, grumbling about returning from their failed attempts to sell off outfits from the nearby outfitters at hiked prices.`

Looking up from the spaceport, you can see a number of republic ships passing by overhead, with your ship picking up occaisional radio signals blipping in and out.`

	spaceport ` While stepping off of your ship, you notice something scurry past you. You turn around and look behind you and see a small ferret-like robot making its way towards the outer rim, melting bits of chipped-off metal and patching different sections of the damaged landing pads. Occaisionally, you can see one of them grab a small peice of an asteroid and bring it back into the station.`

			`	While in orbit, you notice an unfamiliar station within the Ruticulus system and decide to approach it. You can see very large ridges covering the surface of the station, moving like small waves in an ocean.`
			`	As you get closer the surface of the station, you quickly realize that that the ridges you saw on the surface of the station were not just moving sections of the station, but massive assembly lines, spanning the entire way across the station. There is a structural beam at the center of the station that stretches all the way to both ends, and is filled with bridges and connections to the different factories and assembly lines. `

We are even willing to allow trusted members of Solaria to purchase our duplicates of said discovered technology. However..." He pauses briefly, looking somewhat embarassed before continuing.`
