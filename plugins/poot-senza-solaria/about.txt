Adds Senza Solaria Station, a station that stocks all outfits,
but needs you to bring them there first.

ALSO check out P.O.O.T. (Whenever it releases...)



... well since you're reading the credits, here's
 a fun fact for you, you dedicated reader you: this
 station originally was going to be an updated 
 version of Ursa Polaris used in Peripherals 
 Or Outstanding Trinkets, but I ended up deciding
 to just make my own all-outfits station with 
 custom rules. Ended up being a much nicer result 
 than what I was originally thinking about making.
