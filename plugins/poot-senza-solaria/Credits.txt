Adds Senza Solaria Station, a station that stocks all outfits,
but needs you to bring them there first.

ALSO check out P.O.O.T. (Whenever it releases...)



	Shoutout to LocalGod79, the original Ursa Polaris was a big inspiration to the Senza Solaris Station.





( Fun fact for anyone who actually reads the credits, this station originally was going to be an updated version of Ursa Polaris, but I decided to just make my own all-outfits station in a way I found to be the most enjoyable)
