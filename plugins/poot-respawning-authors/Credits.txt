Adds versions of all vanilla person ships that respawn.
They also spawn more frequently, and all can spawn in any system.

NOTE: All the ships that spawn from this plugin are NOT the original ships, to make the original ships obtainable, you can install Senza Solaria which has compatibility for Respawning Authors

Also does NOT disable vanilla authors.



ALSO check out P.O.O.T. (Whenever it releases...)
