# Respawning Author Ships
This plugin makes Author ships respawn and appear more than once in a playthrough, it does so by adding a new fleet which contains all author ships, and can appear in any system.
## Features
 - All author ships are capturable (**NOTE:** the ships that appear are not all the _exact original_ author ships in the base game, some are modified versions that are now able to be captured.)
 - Author ships appear more frequently
 - Certain authors will spawn more frequently in certain parts of the galaxy
 - Original author ships do still spawn in addition to the now respawning ships
 - The base game Author government does not share any reputation with the respawning author ships
 - _some secret variants..._

_This plugin is compatible with [Senza Solaria Station](https://github.com/Eggapegawsus/Eggapegawsus-endless-sky-plugins/tree/main/plugins/poot-senza-solaria)_
