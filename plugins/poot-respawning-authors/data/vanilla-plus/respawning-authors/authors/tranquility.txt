phrase "Author (Tranquility)"
	word
		"They tell ya never to hit a man with a closed fist, but it is on occasion hilarious."
		"The human body can be drained of blood in 8.6 seconds given adequate vacuuming systems."
		"I remember too much, and... some of it's made up, and... some of it can't be quantified, and... there's secrets."
		"I reattached a girl's leg. Her whole leg. She named her hamster after me."
		"No power in the 'verse can stop me."
		"Hey, I've been in a firefight before! Well, I was in a fire. Actually, I was fired from a fry-cook opportunity."
		"I can kill you with my brain."
		"My food is problematic."
		"Any well-bred petty crook knows that the small, concealable weapons go to the far left of the place setting."
		"You can't take the sky from me."
		"They don't like it when you shoot at 'em. I worked that out myself."
		"Woo! This kind of flying really wakes up a guy!"
		"I am a leaf on the wind. Watch how I soar."
		"If you can't do somethin' smart... do somethin' right."
		"Did something just fly off my gorram ship?"
		"We are just too pretty for God to let us die."
		"If I ever kill you, you'll be awake, you'll be facing me, and you'll be armed."
		"We're all doomed! Who's flying this thing!? Oh right, that would be me."
		"I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you."
		"Just once I'd like things to go according to the gorram plan."
		"I'm a dangerous-minded man on a ship loaded with hurt."
