	description "While in flight, it it looked to be a normal subsidurial, but upon closer inspection, you come to realize that its not even a sbusidurial. It's actually a heavily modified warship, whose origin you cannot make out. Whoever decided to build this ship did a fantastic job at recreating the appearance of the original."
