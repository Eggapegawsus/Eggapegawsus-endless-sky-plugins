	description "When the Free Worlds started requesting a Carrier solution from its local shipyards, Tarazed Shipyards quickly saw that a few modifications could make their entry level interceptor into a top tier fighter. Over 85% of the parts that make up the Finch are shared with the Sparrow assembly line, so it's no surprise that even trimmed down to (barely) fit into a fighter bay, the blindingly fast Finch bears strong resemblance to its hyperspace-faring cousin."
	description "	Fighters do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a fighter unless you have a ship in your fleet with a fighter bay."
