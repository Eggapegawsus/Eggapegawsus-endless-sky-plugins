# Senza Solaria Updater and Plugin Generator
This is a python script designed to parse through the Endless Sky directory or the plugin directory, and automatically make a plugin to be used alongside Senza Solaria. There are also some additional features included (More info below)
<br>
## How to Use

 - Start by copying the folder path of the plugin or game directory you wish to use (*NOTE: The selected directory MUST BE IN A FOLDER CALLED "plugins" "or" "Endless Sky")*
 - Text 2
This script will parse through a given directory for .txt files, and if it finds any matching an outfit or ship description, will give them a mission to be supported and used with Senza Solaria. This script is setup by default to work in the plugins folder, and in Endless Skys main folder (Specifically the steam release of the game).

NOTE: in order for the script to work, the target file or directory MUST BE LOCATED within a folder called "plugins" or "Endless Sky".
This is a safeguard to prevent the file from trying to scan an entire computers contents and causing who-knows-what kind of issues.

Feel free to use and modify this script as is needed.
