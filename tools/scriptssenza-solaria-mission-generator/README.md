This script generates proper mission and outfitter files for any directory input.

NOTE: the target file or directory MUST BE LOCATED within a folder called "plugins" or "Endless Sky".
I apologize for the lack of flexibility in this, but this is a safeguard to prevent the file from trying to scan an entire computers contents and causing who-knows-what kind of issues.
